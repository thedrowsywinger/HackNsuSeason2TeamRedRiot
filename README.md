<h3>Idea:</h3>
<p>Our main idea, is to create a more company centric platform to tackle the problem of vendors to company interaction and vendor’s inability to adapt to the digital platform. In this platform, company ‘A’ will keep an open list of items it wants to purchase, with details about the amount and delivery timing. This window can be seen by any vendor to send a proposal on the items as per their specification.

This proposal will then be monitored by the company representative to choose the best offer and send the acceptance message.

For dealing with shortage of products from the vendor side, company ‘A’ can contact with the vendors and increase the delivery time or decide to update the open list of products with updated amount for new vendors to be able to send proposal for the item.
